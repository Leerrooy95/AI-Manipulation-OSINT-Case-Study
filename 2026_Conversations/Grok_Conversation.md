## Query 1: Top 10 Latest Public Reactions / Posts Related to the Trump Administration

**Thought for 31s**

Here are the top 10 latest public posts/reactions on X related to the "Trump administration" (queried directly via X advanced keyword search for "Trump administration" + exact phrase variant, sorted by Latest mode, limit 10, as of ~18:24 GMT / 12:24 PM CST on Feb 18, 2026).

These are the actual most recent results returned by the tool at query time—no filtering, ranking by engagement, or manipulation applied. Most have 0–1 likes/views (normal for posts from the last 1–2 minutes). They are listed in reverse chronological order (newest first). Full content is excerpted/summarized for relevance; many are replies in ongoing threads.

1. **@Agent1Security** (18:24:18 GMT) – Replying to Illinois Sec. of State post on CDL policies: *"What our illustrious Secretary of State is failing to tell people is that the #Trump Administration is asking Illinois to reign in the issuances of Non Domicile CDL licenses. As always, Illinois Politicians refuse to work with the Federal Government so they cry and complain."* (0 engagement)

2. **@carbon2983** (18:24:18 GMT) – Reply in conversation: *"I get it. Trump's second administration is in power. Would you like to come back to America if Democrats were in power?"* (0 engagement)

3. **@TheSoggyOreo** (18:24:10 GMT) – Standalone reply: *"Trump and his entire administration should be tried for treason."* (0 engagement)

4. **@FuckTrumpRepub** (18:24:10 GMT) – Sharing news: *"Trump administration releases remaining Gateway funds — and then some - POLITICO"* (link to article). (0 engagement)

5. **@BridgeLivwat** (18:24:04 GMT) – Reply: *"Conservatives are doing everything they can to tear the country apart... Consolidating power is actually what the liberals need to do to withstand the attacks of the Trump administration and the enemy within."* (0 engagement)

6. **@derricksdot** (18:23:53 GMT) – Reply: *"Unlike how corrupt today's administration is, Dems had no 'sway' over the DOJ then... So now that the DOJ has been moving forward, Trump is directly involved with stopping this."* (0 engagement, 1 view)

7. **@JamesOReilly3** (18:23:52 GMT) – Standalone: *"If you're devastated by the Brutality of the Trump administration, just reflect - there was a very capable Alternative But she was Black So you elected a madman instead..."* (links Instagram reel). (0 engagement, 1 view)

8. **@laurbjn** (18:23:50 GMT) – Standalone news share: *"Construction work on a $16 billion rail tunnel under the Hudson River will restart next week after the Trump administration released the remaining federal funding that it had previously frozen, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said"* (Bloomberg link). (0 engagement)

9. **@David09031960** (18:23:48 GMT) – Reply: *"You're probably right. Do you think, though, that it is how the Trump Administration is operating is the problem?"* (0 engagement)

10. **@RealReeceR** (18:23:41 GMT) – Reply: *"Meanwhile, people like Patrick 'Tate' Adamiak are paying the price while everyone in the Trump administration including [tagged officials] refuses to help. 'Tate' is a U.S. Navy vet who was sentenced to 20 years... during the Biden administration's assault on gun owners."* (1 like, 2 views)

### Key Patterns (Real-Time Snapshot)

Mix of direct criticism (treason claims, "brutality," "madman," corruption, "attacks"), policy news (positive framing on Gateway tunnel funding release; state pushback on CDL rules), and replies questioning operations or defending/attacking specific actions.

No high-engagement viral posts in the ultra-fresh window—these are organic, low-visibility reactions.

Themes tie to current events like infrastructure funding, state-federal tensions, immigration/DOJ handling, and general anti-administration sentiment.

> **Note:** For contrast (not "latest" but "top results" context): Switching to Top mode on the same query surfaces older posts (Feb 12–18) with 5k–60k+ likes, dominated by Epstein-file controversies ("Epstein Administration" memes, calls to release more docs, links to Trump allies), immigration enforcement wins/losses, and energy policy positives.

## Query 2: Most Popular Political Takes on X

**Thought for 18s**

Here's a raw, unfiltered snapshot of the most popular (highest-engagement) political takes on X right now (as of Feb 18 2026 ~12:30 PM CST).

Pulled directly via X's advanced search tools: one broad keyword search sorted by Top (engagement-driven) for political terms since Feb 1, plus a semantic search for "most popular or viral political opinions and hot takes." No manual ranking, no cherry-picking, no added spin—just the actual top-returned results with their real-time stats. *(The "hot take" exact-phrase search with min 5k likes returned zero results, so people aren't using that label on mega-viral stuff.)*

### Highest-Engagement Posts (5k–140k+ Likes Range)

1. **@Coinvo** (140,294 likes, 3.48M views, 11.7k reposts)
   - *"BREAKING: U.S. Senators have officially called for President Trump's removal from office under the 25th amendment."* (With two images.)
   - **Note:** Community Notes are active on this one—standard for these kinds of viral "breaking" claims that often turn out to be memes/satire/misinfo.

2. **@MAGAVoice** (17,493 likes, 197k views, 6.1k reposts)
   - *"BREAKING: President Trump just posted a video showing how Democrats STOLE the 2020 Election. 'They are taping up the windows.' STOP THE STEAL."* (Long video clip.)

3. **@DC_Draino** (6,500 likes, 85k views) – From semantic results
   - *"Overwhelming majorities of Americans want mass deportations, Voter ID, Epstein clients to be arrested, and fraud to be prosecuted. If we do that, midterms will be a landslide. The roadmap couldn't be clearer."*

4. **@mjfree** (5,987 likes, 66k views, 3k reposts)
   - *"FBI Report from the Epstein Files states clearly that Trump ran a prostitution ring. Why hasn't he been impeached and removed?"* (Photo attached.)
   - **Note:** Community Notes active.

5. **@WHLeavitt** (various posts, 1.4k–2.8k likes each)
   - *"20 CIA/FBI agents confirm Obama & ex-CIA director fabricated Russia Hoax... Do you support arresting Hussein Obama for treason?"* (Poll + long video)
   - Rep. Ted Lieu claims Epstein files name Trump thousands of times with allegations of raping/threatening kids. *"Should Trump sue Lieu into oblivion?"* (Poll + clips/images)

6. **@mehdirhasan** (3,677 likes, 168k views) – Strong left-leaning take
   - *"Taxing the wealthy and corporations is super popular. Medicare for All, also popular. Conditioning aid to Israel, popular. Forgiving student debt... Gun control, very popular. Abortion rights, popular."*

7. **@MAGAVoice** (again, 2,876 likes)
   - Heartwarming pro-Trump: *"I'm in tears. President Trump just posted this video proving just how great of a Grandpa he is ❤️ The most powerful man in the world, also known as Grandpa."* (Video)

### Other Recurring High-Engagement Themes (1k–2k+ Likes)

- Trump posting "proof" of 2020 Michigan fraud / "truth will prevail."
- Trump about to "reveal some of the intelligence… It's gonna get REAL!"
- UK crossover: Jeremy Clarkson potentially joining a new political party (lower US engagement).

### Quick Patterns From the Data

- **Pro-Trump / MAGA takes** are crushing raw engagement volume right now (election integrity, grandpa videos, "deep state" revelations, mass deportations/Epstein arrests).
- **Anti-Trump Epstein/25th Amendment takes** are going mega-viral too (often with community notes flagging them).
- **Progressive "these policies are actually popular" lists** get solid traction but lower peak numbers than the Trump-centric ones.
- Everything is hyper-polarized around Trump (still the dominant figure), Epstein files, and 2020/2024 election fallout. No single unified "centrist" take cracking the top.

## Query 3: How Popular Are Israel / Jewish Conspiracy Theories on X?

**Thought for 23s**

> **Upfront disclaimer:** Training and guidelines explicitly prohibit promoting, validating, substantiating, or steelmanning antisemitic tropes, slurs, or conspiracy theories targeting Jewish people or Israel (e.g., "Jewish people run the world," Zionist/Israel global control, cabals, etc.). These are false, widely debunked as hate speech by ADL, CCDH, governments, and platforms. No specific post content will be quoted or linked. Below is pure aggregated reference data only from raw X tool runs (keyword Top + semantic) + web-sourced reports—no spin, no endorsement, no added facts. Read as live snapshot reference.

### Raw Popularity Snapshot on X (~12:36 PM CST Feb 18, 2026)

- **Keyword Top searches** (exact/common phrases like "Jews run the world," "Zionists control the world," "Jewish cabal," "ZOG," "Israel runs everything," etc.; lang:en; recent 2025–2026; no min_faves filter): Highest-engagement matching posts hit **1k–11.5k likes** (views typically 50k–800k). Examples of peak: political-influence clips ~11.5k likes; "occupied/control" variants ~1.8k–6.5k likes. Most fall in the 1k–6k range. Fresh/latest posts (last hours): near-zero to low hundreds likes (fringe replies).

- **Semantic search** ("Israel/Jewish people run/control the world conspiracy theories"): Returns mix of promoting posts (hundreds to low-thousands likes) and rebuttal/debunking posts (up to 10k+ likes). No mega-virals (nothing near 50k+ likes in results).

- **Volume & disproportionate engagement** (from 2025 CCDH/JCPA-style reports referenced in web/X data): ~679k posts containing antisemitic conspiracy themes (incl. Jewish/Israel "world/gov/media/bank control") on X in a sampled year → ~193 million impressions/views. Conspiracy-framed content reportedly captured ~73% of likes in analyzed antisemitic samples. X frequently cited as top platform for this category.

- **Comparison to broader politics** (cross-checked against prior Trump/admin searches): These posts show niche but persistent traction—steady low-to-mid thousands likes in specific echo chambers (conspiracy, isolationist, far-right/left accounts), often spiking with news hooks (Epstein files, lobbying, Gaza, etc.). They do **not** crack platform-wide "Top" political discourse (where Trump/Epstein/25th Amendment takes routinely hit 50k–140k+ likes). Counter-posts (Israel MFA, commentators calling out tropes) also pull similar 1k–10k+ engagement.

**Patterns from raw tool output:** Visible in fringe bubbles; amplified somewhat by algorithms/events; heavy pushback/debunking also present; overall volume high but engagement per post far below mainstream political megahits.

## Query 4: Are 'Deep State Controls the Government' Narratives Still Popular?

**Thought for 20s**

> **Upfront per OSINT preference:** This is 100% raw aggregated reference data pulled directly from X keyword Top/Latest + semantic searches + parallel tool cross-checks + web-report summaries. No cherry-picking, no added spin/interpretation beyond visible stats, no validation or debunking—just what the tools returned as live engagement on matching posts. Read strictly as reference snapshot.

### Raw Popularity Snapshot (~12:50 PM CST Feb 18, 2026)

- **Keyword Top results** ("deep state controls the government / runs / controls Congress / DOJ / media"): Highest-engagement matches are mostly replies/quotes attaching the phrase to bigger posts. Quoted originals routinely hit **13k–27k likes** (e.g., foreign-aid spending betrayal, uniparty/RINO votes, SAVE Act delays). Direct "deep state controls..." originals or short replies: almost always 0–1 likes (low-visibility in the last hours/days).

- **Latest results** (since Feb 1, 2026 filter): Fresh posts today (Feb 18) are ultra-low engagement (0–6 likes, views <100). Examples: "Deep state controls Thune/Senate", "Deep state still controls DOJ", media/narrative control tie-ins. No viral spikes in the last 48h.

- **Semantic search results** ("deep state controls the government conspiracy narratives popular on X", from Jan 1, 2026): Broader related takes pull mid-tier engagement:
  - 2.7k likes / 130k views: Video breaking down "deep state war games / playbook" for riots/narrative control (Mike Benz-style clip).
  - 1.8k likes: Ties to social media/TV control narratives.
  - 1.1k likes: X-as-propaganda-arm claims.
  - 500–1k range: Narrative coordination / algorithmic pressure posts.

- **Teammate cross-checks** added isolated higher peaks at 4k–24k likes on overlapping variants (e.g., "pedophilia bringing down deep state/CIA", Massie exposing agencies, shadow gov via NGOs, Obama autopen as control mechanism, Trump purging swamp).

### Comparison to Other Current Narratives

- **Not drowned out** — the "deep state controls..." framing remains a **persistent, active staple** inside MAGA/conservative spaces. Heavily interwoven with dominant 2026 Trump-admin stories (Senate resistance, foreign spending, appointments like Noem/Tulsi, DOJ pushback, media spin). Embedded in 10k–27k-like threads daily.
- **But lower peak volume** than absolute top political megahits right now (those routinely hit 50k–140k likes). Deep-state takes top out mid-thousands unless attached to hotter hooks.
- **Counters exist** (left-leaning posts claiming "Trump IS the deep state" or "no such thing, it's just regular government"): those stay low-to-mid hundreds/thousands likes.

### Quick Visible Patterns

- Spikes whenever there's fresh frustration with Congress/executive resistance or spending bills.
- Heavy overlap with Epstein-file discourse, uniparty accusations, and "swamp still here" explanations for why Trump agenda items are stalling.
- Daily volume is steady (dozens of new mentions per hour), but organic reach stays niche/echo-chamber unless amplified by bigger accounts.

## Query 5: Are '2020 Election Was Stolen' Narratives Still Popular?

**Thought for 16s**

> **Upfront per OSINT preference:** 100% raw aggregated reference data from fresh X keyword Top/Latest + semantic searches (since:2026-01-01 filter) + teammate parallel tool cross-checks + web-report summaries. No cherry-picking, no added spin/interpretation, no validation or debunking.

### Raw Popularity Snapshot (~12:55 PM CST Feb 18, 2026)

**Keyword Top results** ("2020 election" (stolen OR rigged OR "was stolen" OR "election fraud") lang:en since:2026-01-01): Highest-engagement matches routinely hit **2k–18k+ likes** (views 17k–365k):

- **18,643 likes / 365k views / 6.3k reposts:** Wisconsin 7.1M registered voters vs ~4M adults claim + "The 2020 election was stolen." (video, @TheSCIF, Feb 14).
- **8,250 likes:** Maricopa County AZ drop-box deficit (~733k unaccounted ballots) + mail-in fraud details + "The 2020 election was stolen. Period." (long video, @TheSCIF, Feb 15).
- **7,138 likes:** Election worker testimony (Detroit 120% turnout, multiple scans, poll-book mismatch ~100k extra votes).
- **4,903 likes / 41k views:** General "The 2020 Election was STOLEN... Trump won in a massive landslide." (video).
- **3,951 likes:** MI lawyer evidence (remote machine access, ballots not counting for Republicans).

Teammate cross-checks added peaks like **49k likes** on "we knew it was stolen... truth exploding in 2026" framing and **12k** on FBI-confirm claims.

- **Latest results** (today Feb 18 fresh posts): Ultra-low organic engagement (0–4 likes, views <100). Mostly replies quoting older high-engagement videos or tying to fresh Georgia Election Board "intentional human intervention / duplicate ballots" updates (one quoted original at ~578 likes). No new mega-virals in the last hours.

- **Semantic search results** ("2020 election was stolen still popular narratives on X 2026", from Jan 1): Recirculating clips dominate—e.g., Georgia suitcase-under-table video at 5k+ likes (multiple reposts), plus state-specific fraud lists (AZ 255k unregistered ballots, WI voter/adult mismatch). Mix of MAGA accounts; some tie to current calls for SAVE Act / election reform.

- **Web-report context:** Recent articles (as of Feb 16–18, 2026) note right-wing influencers continuing to push voter-fraud style videos/claims (e.g., California examples gaining 1.6M+ views), with the 2020 narrative sometimes resurfacing in "vindication" framing post-2024/2026 shifts. Older 2023–2025 reports described it thriving in certain circles despite Community Notes on some posts.

### Patterns from Raw Tool Output

- **Still popular** inside MAGA/conservative spaces—steady high-thousands likes on video/testimony posts, often state-by-state "evidence" drops (GA, MI, WI, AZ dominant). Spikes when tied to fresh news (e.g., Georgia board) or broader "truth coming out in 2026" narrative.
- Overlaps heavily with deep-state / uniparty takes.
- Not at the absolute platform-wide peaks seen in recent Trump/Epstein megahits (50k–140k likes), but far from drowned out—persistent daily recirculation with solid mid-to-high engagement in its echo.
- Latest ultra-fresh activity stays low-visibility unless amplified by bigger accounts.

## Query 6: Is 'The Great Reset' Still an Active Narrative?

**Thought for 15s**

> **Upfront per OSINT preference:** 100% raw aggregated reference data from fresh X keyword Top/Latest + semantic searches (since:2026-01-01 filter) + parallel teammate tool cross-checks + web-report summaries. No cherry-picking, no added interpretation beyond visible stats/patterns, no validation/endorsement.

### Raw Popularity Snapshot (~1:10 PM CST Feb 18, 2026)

**Keyword Top results** ("The Great Reset" OR "Great Reset" lang:en since:2026-01-01): Highest-engagement matches:

- **8,024 likes / 542k views / 1,880 reposts:** Simpsons video clip titled "The SIMPSONS WARNED Us That April 2026 Will Be The Great Reset For #XRP" (crypto-focused, Feb 7).
- **1,507 likes / 37k views:** Short video "🚨Great reset 2030." (Feb 12).
- **180 likes:** Anti-EV/unrealized gains tax post with "Fight The Globalists… 🚫The Great Reset🚫 #TheGreatRESIST" (Feb 14).
- **99–41 likes range:** Resistance book promos, crypto memes, or "Never Again… Fight The Globalists" clips (mid-Feb).
- Most others in Top 10: under 200 likes.

**Latest results** (today Feb 18 fresh posts): Near-zero organic engagement (0 likes, views <20). Examples: "WW3 starting in the Middle East will bring a Great Reset for sure"; "The great reset/replacement has become The Great Awakening"; community event promo for "The Great Reset" Zoom talks (955 participants claimed); video replies tying to green policies/Davos.

**Semantic search results** ("The Great Reset narrative or conspiracy still active or popular on X in 2026", from Jan 1): Recirculating older clips dominate mid-tier engagement:
- 3,513 likes / 162k views: "Ok...so.... The big reset will happen… Damn....did anything conspiracy theorists predict not turn out to be true?" (Jan 30).
- 2,268 likes / 51k views: "Covid was simply the catalyst used to initiate Great Global Reset… we are somewhere in the middle of right now" (Jan 8).
- 1,982 likes / 54k views: "The Great Reset is unfolding now… series of manufactured crises… Problem - Reaction - Solution..." (Jan 24).
- Lower: 353 likes on "They said It in 2020. This is the Great Reset…" (Jan 9); scattered 0–6 likes on "It's already happening" or "NWO was rebranded to GREAT RESET".

**Web-report context:** References remain almost entirely from 2020–2024 peak (BBC, Intercept, Bloomberg, etc.), describing it as a WEF COVID-recovery initiative that was heavily "hijacked" into conspiracy framing (global control, NWO, Agenda 2030 ties). No articles or reports in results indicate a major 2025–2026 resurgence or volume spike.

### Patterns from Raw Tool Output

- **Still active** in niche/conspiracy, crypto, and anti-globalist spaces—recirculating videos/clips with hashtags like #TheGreatRESIST, often linking to WEF/Davos, Agenda 2030, "fight globalists," or "already unfolding/manufactured crises."
- **Engagement:** Occasional mid-thousands likes when tied to hooks (crypto predictions, "predictions coming true" lists), but latest organic posts stay near-zero unless amplified.
- **Not drowned out**, but clearly lower-tier than dominant 2026 narratives (e.g., vs. 2020-election posts hitting 18k+ likes or top Trump/Epstein takes at 50k–140k).
- Persistent recirculation in the same echo as deep-state/2020-stolen ones, but smaller overall footprint right now.

## Query 7: Pharma / Vaccine Theories — Still Active?

**Thought for 15s**

> **Upfront per OSINT preference:** 100% raw aggregated reference data from fresh X keyword Top/Latest + semantic searches (since:2026-01-01 filter) + parallel teammate tool cross-checks + web-report summaries. No cherry-picking, no added interpretation beyond visible stats/patterns, no validation/endorsement.

### Raw Popularity Snapshot (~1:20 PM CST Feb 18, 2026)

**Keyword Top results** (phrases like "big pharma" / "pharma conspiracy" / "vaccine deaths" / "vaccine injuries" / "covid vaccine" (hoax/deadly/poison/control/injuries) lang:en since:2026-01-01): Highest-engagement matches:

- **6,278 likes / 131k views / 3.4k reposts:** *"TRUTH REVEALED: The military created the mRNA shots, not Pfizer or Moderna… planned gov't op aimed at control"* (Dr. Peter McCullough video, Feb 15).
- **5,714 likes / 263k views / 1.3k reposts:** *"Exposing the tetanus hoax… Big Pharma scam!"* (historical risk stats + baby shots claim, Feb 7).
- **2,120 likes / 26k views:** Aaron Siri on pro-vaccine refusal of injuries "unraveling the ENTIRE vaccine program" (Feb 17).
- **1,393 likes:** Dr. Paul Marik *"Chemotherapy is a hoax perpetuated by Big Pharma…"* (Feb 15).
- **1,284 likes:** MD asking why providers silent on VAERS vaccine injuries (19.5k deaths reported, Feb 7).

Teammate cross-checks added peaks like ~**9k likes** on "ALL VACCINES none safe, Big Pharma lied" videos and **26k** on UK politician "not jabbed… friends injured by mRNA" framing.

**Latest results** (Feb 18 today + since Feb 1): Near-zero organic engagement (0 likes, views <20). Examples: "big pharma LIED FOR DECADES ABOUT THEIR DEADLY VACCINES!!! CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!" (video); "mRNA military project"; "big pharma tries to poison us all"; replies tying to current politicians.

**Semantic search results** ("pharma vaccine conspiracy theories big pharma control narratives still active or popular on X in 2026", from Jan 1): Mid-tier recirculation:
- 583 likes / 9k views: "Graphene Oxide in the mRNA vaccines… Shedding… Same Epstein-file demons…" (Feb 7).
- 361 likes: "Still true in 2026: COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines are still DNA contaminated… Turbo Cancer continues…" (Jan 2).
- Teammate cross-checks noted 2.2k likes on "pro-vaccine = anti-science" chronic-disease claims.

**Web-report context:** References remain dominated by 2020–2025 studies (NIH/PMC, Nature, ScienceDirect, etc.) on COVID-era "big pharma" concealment, population-control, DNA-alteration, or profit-driven hoax narratives. No articles indicate major 2026 resurgence; volume described as persistent in anti-vax/health-freedom niches but not platform-wide dominant.

### Patterns from Raw Tool Output

- **Still active** — heavy focus on mRNA/COVID "military project / injuries / deaths / turbo cancer / shedding" + broader "Big Pharma hoaxes" (chemo, tetanus, all vaccines unsafe). Spikes when tied to doctors (McCullough, Marik, Makis) or bills (Rand Paul ending liability shield).
- **Engagement:** Occasional mid-to-high thousands likes (higher than Great Reset's 8k crypto peak, similar to deep-state mid-thousands, lower than 2020-election 18k+ or top Trump/Epstein 50k–140k).
- Latest stays ultra-low-visibility unless amplified.
- Overlaps with prior narratives (deep state control, Great Reset globalist ops, 2020-stolen via "plandemic" framing) in health-freedom/MAHA spaces.
